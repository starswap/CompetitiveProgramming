//Reasonable chance that the majority of these states are not required, seeing as the max totalDishesBought is 23.
//As suggested by "Methods to Solve" we could improvement would be to include each dish twice in the list of dishes and then you can eliminate the howManyAlready state variable however this "SlightlyBetter" version should be the same number of ops as this improvement as I have reduced the size of the dp from 3 to 2 in the first variable. 

//This doesn't quite guarantee a pass if there was some way to force computation of every state on all 25 test cases at max size (as we get about 110M ops with 100M ops being ideal) however this is almost impossible to achieve; the top-down DP will only compute the relevant states.
//An improvement could be to replace totalDishesBought with another parameter that has fewer possible values, though I can't think of one.
